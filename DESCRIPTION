Description: A tool for easily matching spatial data when you have a list of
    place/region names. You might have a data frame that came from a
    spreadsheet tracking some data by suburb or state. This package can
    convert it into a spatial data frame ready for plotting. The actual map
    data is provided by other packages (or your own code).
