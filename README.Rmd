If you have a list of place/region names (for example as a column in a data frame) and
you'd like to turn that into spatial data, `{cartographer}` can help. There are 2 steps:

  1. Register the spatial data with `{cartographer}` using `register_map()`, or load a
     package that already did that for you.
  2. Use `add_geometry()` to turn your ordinary data frame into a spatial one.

`{cartographer}` complains if it doesn't recognise any of the place names, and can handle
aliases, for example abbreviated state names.

See `vignette("cartographer")` for examples, and `{ggautomap}` for some handy ggplot
helpers that pull map data using `{cartographer}`.

## Installation

You can install cartographer like so:

``` r
# CRAN release
install.packages('cartographer')

# development version
install.packages('cartographer', repos = c('https://cidm-ph.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

## Map data

Some packages provide data that works with `{cartographer}`:

  * `{maps}` - some dated example maps of the world and several countries.
  * `{rnaturalearth}` - countries and states (where available).
  * `{nswgeo}` - maps of New South Wales, Australia.
    
Alternatively, you can register your own data using `register_map()` (see `vignette("registering_maps")`).
