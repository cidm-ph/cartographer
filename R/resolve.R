#' Guess the feature type if it was missing
#'
#' If `feature_type` is provided, this simply checks that the type has been
#' registered. If it is `NA`, however, an attempt it made to guess the
#' appropriate choice. This is done by comparing the example values provided
#' as `feature_names` with the names of all registered map datasets. If there
#' is an unambiguous match, that will be filled in.
#'
#' Note that this requires that any lazily-loaded datasets are loaded, so there
#' is a penalty to pay for the convenience.
#'
#' @param feature_type Type of map feature. See [feature_types()] for a list of
#'   registered types. If \code{NA}, the type is guessed based on the values in
#'   `feature_names`.
#' @param feature_names Character vector of feature names in the data. This can
#'   be a subset of the values.
#'
#' @returns The resolved feature type as a scalar character.
#' @export

#' @examples

#'
#' @param feature_names Character vector of feature names in the data.
#' @param feature_type Type of map feature. See [feature_types()] for a list of

#' @param unmatched Controls behaviour when `feature_names` contains values
