\title{Turn Place Names into Map Data}
\description{
Cartographer is a framework for easily matching spatial data when
you have a list of standardised place names. You might have a data frame
that came from a spreadsheet tracking some data by suburb or state. This
package can convert it into a spatial data frame ready for plotting. The
actual map data is provided by other packages (or your own code) that
register the data with cartographer.
